                        The life cycle begins when a female butterfly lays tiny eggs, usually on the underside of a leaf of a specific "host plant." These eggs are often oval or cylindrical and can vary in color. The host plant is crucial because it will be the primary food source for the caterpillar once it hatches. The incubation period typically lasts a few days, depending on the butterfly species and environmental conditions.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        Once the egg hatches, a larva, commonly known as a caterpillar, emerges. The caterpillar's primary job is to eat and grow. It consumes vast amounts of leaves from its host plant, increasing its size dramatically. As it grows, the caterpillar sheds its skin multiple times in a process called molting, as its exoskeleton cannot grow with it. Each stage between molts is called an instar. This stage can last from a few weeks to several months, depending on the species.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        After reaching its full size, the caterpillar forms a pupa. For butterflies, this pupa is called a chrysalis. The chrysalis is often green or brown and blends in with its surroundings, providing camouflage. Inside this protective casing, an incredible transformation, known as metamorphosis, takes place. The caterpillar's body breaks down and reorganizes into the adult butterfly form. This stage can last from a few weeks to two years, depending on the species and climate.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        Finally, the adult butterfly emerges from the chrysalis. Initially, its wings are soft and crumpled, but the butterfly pumps fluid into them to expand and harden them. Once its wings are ready, the adult butterfly's main purpose is to reproduce. It feeds on nectar from flowers, which provides energy for flight and mating. The adult stage can last from a few days to several months, depending on the species, before the cycle begins anew.
